    Means of Travel to Work in Scotland in 1991
    Seen from the chart,it can be concluded that Scottish people were most likely to 
drive a car to work rather than other means of transportation in 1991.Among all the 
people going to work,car drivers account for 59% while bus riders make up 18%,walkers
15% and train travelers only 3%.
    It is not wonder that so many people chose car driving to go to work.They could 
take full advantage of its speed and convenience.Less people chose buses or walking,
mainly because the former could only offer limited routes and the latter was time-
consuming.
    In my own practice,I think it not advisable at al for me to drive a car to work.
On the one hand,I cannot afford a car at this moment.On the other hand,my company is
only minutes away from my home,and I take great delight in walking to and from work.
To keep fit and stay healthy,I must seize every opportunity to participate in physical
exercises.
