    People's working Hours
    From the charts we can see clearly that 29% of the employees work full time,33% work 
more than 41 hours a week,and the rest employees work not more than 35 hours a week.
Compared with employees,most owners have longer business hours.On average,almost half
of the working people are so diligent that they have practically become workaholics.
    In my mind,the reasons why people are so hard-working are as follows.First,it is known
to all  that we will not lead a meaningful life until we achieve our personal fulfillment,
which  can be derived from the work we do.Besides,when we devote ourselves to work,we will
forget all the unhapponess and sadness.
    The negative effects of workig for excessively long hours are also clear.To begin with,
people are likely to develop diseases as a result of great pressure from work.Second,as some
people spend long time in their workplace,they have little time to stay together with their
family and friends,which might lead to a unfavorable interpersonal relationship.
    All in all,I should say the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.Anyway,by working 
hard we can realize our personal values.The key lies in whether we can make good use of time
to balance work and life.
