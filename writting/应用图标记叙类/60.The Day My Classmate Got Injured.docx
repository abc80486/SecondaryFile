    The Day My Classmate Got Injured
    It was a Thursday morning and our morning exercises were going on as usual.It
was still somewhat dark and we were running around the campus,when our classmate 
Li Xiaoming suddenly fell to the ground.
    The teacher ran quickly to his side,and found that his right hand was bleeding
and his left ankle was twisted.She wrapped her handkerchief around Xianming's hand,
another classmate helped him to stand up,and I carried him on my back.We hurried 
to the school clinic,where the doctor quickly treated Xiaoming and found the bones
were not hurt.Until than can we set our hearts at rest.
    On my way back to the dormitory,I thought a lot.If we didn't help Xiaoming,he
would suffer a lot physically and spiritually.Moreover,helping others is equal to 
helping ourselves,because only by doing so can we expect to get help from others 
when we are in trouble.If we are always ready to extend our helping hands.the world
will certainly be a better place to live in !
