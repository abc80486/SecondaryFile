    Software Use in a Certain Region
    During the period between 1998 and 2002,pirated software users declined abruptly from
3000 to 1000,while authorized users increased sharply from 2000 to more than 8000.
    Several reasons can account for this phenomenon.Compared with pirated software,authorized
software can guarantee both high quality and good aftersale service.Apart from that,authorized
software is becoming cheaper and cheaper--more and more people can afford them as a result.
    However,there are still a unmber of people who buy pirated software,generally for twe
reasons.On the one hand,they take it for granted that pirated products are cheaper than
authorized ones.On the other hand,they don't realize that their behavior will do great harm
to the whole software industry and national economy.
