    Marriage and Divice in Our country
    During the period from 1990 to 2000,the number of marriage decreased from 9.51 million
to 8.48 million,while the number of divice rose from 0.8 million to 1.21 million.
    We believe that there reasons can account for this phenomenon.First,young people of
proper marriage age are becoming fewer and fewer because of the family planning policy
adopted since the late 1970s.Second,the current society is full of fierce competition,
and many young people can't and won't get married before they embark on a promising career.
Third,today's people put more and more emphasis upon independence and freedom--they won't 
get married before they find an ideal partner,and they will not hesitate to say goodbye 
when the spark of love dies down.
    The great change,in my mind,signals the fundamental shift in people's view on family 
and marriage.This trend will probably continue as contemporary people pay  more and more 
attention to high-quality marriage.
