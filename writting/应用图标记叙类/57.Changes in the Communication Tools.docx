    Changes in the Communication Tools
    From the chart,we can see chearly that in a big city in China,pager users declined
abruptly from 281 thousand in June 2002 to 155 thousand in February 2003 and then to 87
thousand in October 2003,while mobile phones users rose from 7687 thousand to 9726 thousand
and then to 10715 thousand during the same period.
    Two reasons,in my mind,can account for the fundamental changes in the communication
tools.On the one hand,the pager,although small and cheap,can no longer meet the needs of
modern communication.On the other hand,as the income level rises up,more and more people
can afford a mobile phone and enjoy the convenience it brings.
    Such changes have a significant impact on both individuals and the whole society.For 
one thing,with higher quality of communication and wider coverage of network,mobile phones
play a more and more important role in improving people's living standard.For another,
national communication industry undergoes sustainable development,which is of great 
importance to the national economy as a whole.In a word,the change of communication tools
is beneficial to both individuals and the whole society.
