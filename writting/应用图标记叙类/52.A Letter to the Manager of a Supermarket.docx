    A Letter to the Manager of a Supermarket
                                                    June 19th,2005
Dear Sir,
    I'm writing to inform you of my unhappy experience lately.On July 25th,I 
went to buy a desk lamp in the electric appliances department of your supermarket.
Unfortunately,when I went home,I was astonished to find that it simply stopped
working.
    To resolve the problem,I immediately went back to the center of refund and 
exchange in your store.When I told what had happened to the young lady in charge,
and asked for refund or exchange,she was so rude on that occasion as to interrupt
me continually.Later she even said it was my fault and refused to listen to me any
longer.
    I strongly suggest that lady be instructed on the proper manners towards customers.
I hope you attach importance to this matter,and help settle it as soon as possible.
    With best regards.
                                                                    Yours faithfully
                                                                    Li Xiaoming
