Dear Sir,
    I am writing you this letter to show my keen interest in the post of secretary
which you advertised in yesterday's Los Angeles Times.As is indicated in the enclosed
resume,my major and experience closely parallel your requirements.
    I have always been a top studnet in my specialized area,foreign language and
literature.I took several other courses in my spare time and excelled in all of them
due to my hard work.I am sure such courses as ancient civilizations,German philosophy
and psychology will lend me an edge in the fierce competition in the job market.
Another point I want to draw your attention to is that I have worked as secretary 
in summer and winter vacations in the Huafeng Company.I have also attended several 
meetings and exhibitions on behalf of our company to introduce products to potential
customers.
    I would like to meet you at your earliest convenience and discuss the possibility
of working with your company.Or,if you are too busy there days,you can contact me at
11223344 for further information.Thank you for your favorable consideration.
    Best wishes.
                                                                Your sincerely
                                                                 Jenny Green
