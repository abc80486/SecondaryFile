    An Eye-witness Account of a Fire
    On September 21th,2007,I witnessed a fire accident on Zhongyuan Road on my way
to the supermarket.
    It was around five o'clock in the afternoon and the wind was so strong.Hardly
had I got to a major crossroad when I heard people shouting "Fire,fire",and I shopped.
A two-storied house across the street was on fire,and I dialed 119 quickly.The fire
brigade came immediately and brought the situation under control quickly.The fire was
put out half an hour later,and no serious damage was done.
    In my eyes,the major responsibility for this accident was not human-related.It was
because of the aged-wire that the accident took place.The weather is also to blame--if
the wind had not been so strong,the consequence would not have been so serious.
