    My View on Changing the Major in University
    Recently it has become a common phenomenon for college students to
apply for changing their majors in university. In this way, they will be
switched to another college on campus if their applications are approved.
    Although it may bring unfavorable consequences, we can be sure to 
conclude that this practice is favorable on the whole. To begin with, some
students can't choose their major because their entrance examination scores
are not satisfactory enough, and the new system of changing major gives
them a second chance. Moreover, once they are learning their favorite major,
they will probably be more confident and diligent than before. In the third
place,students learn largely the same basic courses during the first one or 
twe years, and changing major will not bring too much learning difficulties.
    Weighing the pros and cons of such a new trend,we can naturally arrive
at the conclusion that it is beneficial and rewarding.This system not only
gives students a second chance to choose their major,but also prepares
them for the coming competition.
