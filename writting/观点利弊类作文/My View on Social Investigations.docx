    My View on Social Investigations
    Nowadays ,more and more universities and high schools ask students to
take part in social investigations. Many people, however,argue that such
investgations will waste time and engrgy. I cannot agree with them on this
occasion, for the following reasons.
    On the one hand, social investigations provide opportunities for students
to understand the society, which is quite important before they themselves
step into the social in the future. On the other hand, the experience
accumulated in the social investigations will be most helpful to student'
personality development. Last but not least, students'communication skills
will be largely improved.
    In a word, social investigations are necessary for students in that
they are beneficial for the healthy development of student.
