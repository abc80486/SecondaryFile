    My View on the Negative Effects of Plagiarism
    Nowadays every one of us may come across people who copy others'book,
articles or works for their own benefits now and then. This phenomenon is
most harmful to the academic circle and even the whole society.
    In my opinion, their harmfulness can be summarized in the following
three respects.In the first place, the rights of the original copyright holders
are cruelly violated.In the second place,people will lose the impulse to create
if there is plagiarism here and there.Last but not least,plagiarism will lead
to the degradation of the whole academic circle,which includes not only the
publications,but also people's mind.
    In the mind,the government and the citizens should join hands to put an end
to plagiarism.On the one hand,the government should punish the plagiarizers
severely for fear that they harm the authers again.On the other hand,common
citizens should report such harmful phenomenon as soon as possible.Only by the
joint efforts of the government and the common people can we do away with
plagiarism.
