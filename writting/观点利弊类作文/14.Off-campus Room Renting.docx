    Off-campus Room Renting
    Off-campus room renting have brought a lot of benefits to college stud-
ents ever since the beginning.First,it seems the best solution for student-
s who cannot adjust to dormitory life and who show incompetence in roommate
relations.Second,many a senior lives outside to make better preparations f-
or the thesis or examination.Third,room renting means freedom to some stud-
ents,who hate to be regulated by school rules.
    Thought it does good to college students in many ways,off-campus room -
renting can never be said to bring no problems.For one thing,room renting -
is money-consuming for students which will indubitably impose on their par-
ents.For another,too much freedom may result in indulgence and idleness.
    In order to make good use of the chance,I form the habit of making a c-
oncrete plan for each day.On the one hand,I always set aside enough time f-
or study,restricting from playing video games or watching TV.On the other -
hand, I also leave some time to communicate with friends,not only stay in -
the house.By carefully planning my time,I am confident I will spend each d-
ay meaningfully.
