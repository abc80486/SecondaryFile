    Online Job-seeking
    Nowadays,in an era of information and technology, job applicants have
easy access to online job-seeking.The choices are numerous on the Intern-
et.
    As for such a question, different people hold different opinions.Some
believe that online job-seeking is both economical and efficient. Because
people can just stay home,searching for information about the ideal occu-
pations and sending application letters.There is an opposite voice,howev-
er,which clains the disadvantages also exist.For example,some applicants 
often exaggerate their working experience or even lie about their diplom-
as.At the same time,many applicants are trapped by some enterprises who o
ffer false information.
    As far as I'm concerned,I hold the belief that we should deal with t-
he issue cautiously and that a face-to-face interview is necessary in sp-
ite of the advantages of online job-seeking.After all,face-to-face commu-
nication are direat and effective means for the employers as well as the
applicants to understand each other.
