    Advantages and Disadantages of Disposable Chopsticks
    Recently, the use of disposable chopsticks has been brought to popular
attention in China. No one would deny that it is sanitary to use disposable
chopsticks,which aims to prevent the spread of diseases. In addition, it is
alse convenient for people who dine out. However, how many people have ever
taken into account its harm ?
    In the past few years, there has been a sharp growth in the consumption
of disposable chopsticks. More and more people prefer disposable chopsticks
to reusable ones in order to protect themselves from some infectious diseas-
es, unconscious that doing this will result in the problems of deforestation
and soil erosion. What's worse, the used chopsticks are littered everywhere,
which poses a threat to public health. Awareness of the matter in question
is one thing, but more important to us is taking firm action to reduce the
use of disposable chopsticks and call on people to stop using them.
    From what has been discussed above, we can see clearly that the disadva-
ntages are more obvious. Consequently we ought to pay more attention to the
impairment and attach more importance to the environmental protection.Only
in this way can we have a brighter future.
