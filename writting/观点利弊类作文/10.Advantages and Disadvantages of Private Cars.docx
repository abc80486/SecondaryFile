    Advantages and Disvantages of Private Cars
    Nowadays, private cars are playing a more and more important role in
people's daily life. However, people's opinions are still divided on this
point.
    Those who are in faver of private cars claim that it has a lot of adva-
ntages. Firstly, the development of private cars will contribute a lot to n-
ational economy as a whole.Secondly,for individuals who own a private cars, 
they will no longer have to wait for the crowded bus. Last but not least, p-
eople can go sightseeing to neighboring scenic spots on weekends in their o-
wn cars.
    Those who are opposed to the development of private cars hold that disa-
dvantages are many. In the first place, the general living standard is still
quite low, so it is not yet ripe to develop private cars at present. In the-
large numbers of private cars will pollute the environment. Finally, the de-
velopment of private cars has to be in accordance with the fundamental impr-
ovement of transportation. If the road is always jammed, how can we enjoy t-
he pleasure of driving?
    There is some truth in both arguments. But in my mind it is likely to d-
o more good than hard. The past twenty years witnessed the fast development
of the automobile industry along with national economy. A brighter future is
awaiting us if we make good use of private cars.
