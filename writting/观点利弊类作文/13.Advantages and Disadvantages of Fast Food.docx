    Advantages and Disadvantages of Fast Food
    The discussion about fast food has never stopped in the past few years.
Let's have a look at its advantages and disadvantages before drawing the f-
inal conclusion.
    The biggest advantage of fast food is its convenience for customers.You
go into a fast food restaurant,order your food,and your fond gets ready in 
a minute.Therefore,you can save a lot of time.What's more,the environment 
of fast food restaurant is both clean and comfortable.Last but not least,i-
t has excellent service,and the quality of food is guaranteed.
    However,the negetive effects are also obvious.To begin with,in terms of
nutrition,fast food is far from satisfactory.Fast food always contains more
meat and butter and much less vegetable.It doesn't compose a balanced diet 
and it is low in nuitrition,thus eating fast food will result in some dise-
ases in the long term.In the second place,although cooking at home is time-
consuming and tiresome,it provides us more opprtunities of cooperation and
communication with family members and friends.
    Up until now,we can see it clearly that fast food is not beneficial or
harmful in itself.The key lies in the user--so long as we can make properl-
y use of it,it can be most helpful to us in many respects.
