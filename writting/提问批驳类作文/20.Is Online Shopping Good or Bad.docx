    Is Online Shopping Good or Bad ?
    WITH information technology DEVELOPING MORE RAPIDLY AND computers
GETTING MORE WIDELY USED,MORE MODERN PEOPLE TEND TO shop online RATHER THAN
go to shopping malls.
    MANY PEOPLE ARGUE THAT shopping on the internet has its superriority FOR
THE FOLLOWING REASONS.FIRST OF ALL,online shopping is not dependent on some
variables such as weather,place,and time--we can shop online in spite of nas-
ty whether,we can buy goods from a seller thousand miles away,and we can 
make a deal even at midnight.WHAT'S MORE,it saves us much valuable time be-
cause we don't have to walk from one sept to another to compare prices.LAST
BUT NOT LEAST,we can make decisions on our own without being harassed buy
salespeople's endless persuasion.
    PERSONALLY,I BELIEVE we should remain a sober mind as to the issue.
Another side of online shopping is not to be ignored.For instance,it is hard
for us to demand a refund if the goods are defective.However,the develop-
ment of science and technology is by no means unuseful.THE KEY LIES IN THE 
USER--SO LONG AS WE CAN MAKE PROPER USE OF IT,IT CAN BE MOST HELPFUL TO US IN
MANY RESPECTS.
