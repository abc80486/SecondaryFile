    Certificate Craze among College Students
    In current society,we come across too many people who put too much emphasis
an certificates.In many cases,the certificates college students achieved has become
the sole criterion for judging a person,deciding whether he can get the upper hand 
in the competitive employment market.
    I argue that we should not put too much emphasis on certificates.To begin with,
we should not take it for granted that those who hold one or two important certificates
will naturally do a good job.Some certificates turn out to be useless to their future
careers.Moreover,it adds to their financial burden when some students spare no expense
to attend training classes and take various exams.What worries me most is that,spending
so much valuable time preparing certificate exams will probably distract college students
from studying their majors and cultivating their capabilities,which count more than their
prospect.
    All that has been discussed above points to the fact that we need to carry out several
measures to promote a rational attitude towards the issue among college students.First,we
should call on them to attach more importance to their majors.Second,we should make it
known to students that application and ability are more valuable than certificates
themselves.Holpfully these measures will prevent students from following the trend blindly.
