    Marrow Donation
    Nowadays there is a commonly held belief that marrow donation is harmful
to people's health.Actually,it is not the real case.
    On the one hand,the small amount of marrow donated will be recovered in a 
short time for the healthy people.On the other hand,with the development of medical
science,it is possible now for the donator to donate only blood.Most important of
all,donating marrow can save the life of a dying patient,who is suffering from
leukemia.
    We need to carry out several measures to promote marrow donation.First,
we should impart medical knowledge to common citizens,convincing them that marrow
donation is not dangerous at all.Second,we should help people realize that helping
others is helping ourselves,not only because it is a virtue to be ready to help
others,but also because one day we will be in need of help.
