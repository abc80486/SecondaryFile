    Is a Credit Education System Necessary
    A credit educational system will be adopted in many universities,in wh-
ich a student can graduate as soon as he has earned the required credit.<<M-
any people welcome it with applause and enthusiasm,singing high praise of 
such a>> brand-new-system.College students can choose their subjects more fr-
eely and if they are smart,diligent and energetic enough,they can graduate
ahead of time.<<Other people,however,hold that it is untimely for us to do s-
o because>> the overall college education has stayed at a relatively low on 
this occasion.
    <<As far as I am concerned,I am most happy to>> witness the implementation
of such a credit educational system.<<On the one hand>>,the appearance of such
a system will help me develop a more balanced schedule of choosing subject-
s and courses,casting my attention upon college education as a whole.After
repeated efforts,I expect to finish the courses and earn the required cred-
its more quickly,so that I can find a job earlier and live an independent 
life.<<On the other hand>>,this new system will benefit the college education 
as a whole because the twe-way choice compel both teachers and students to
make great efforts to meet the challenge.
    <<How shall I sum up my feeling upon hearing the news of>> this new system?
<<What I want to do most at present is to seize every chance to>> improve my o-
verall ability so as to achieve outstanding performance in all the courses
of my choice.
