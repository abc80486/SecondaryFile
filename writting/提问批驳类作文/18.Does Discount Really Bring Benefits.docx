    Does Discount Really Bring Benefits ?
    <<Some people take it for granted that>> discounted commodities bring them benefits.
 <<Consequently,whenever they make a purchase,they try their best to choose such goods, 
 counting how much money they have saved by this bargain.
    <<Nevertheless,other people claim that such a belief is subjective and unreasonable
even at the first sight.>> <<To begin with,>> if a product can be sold at an appallingly
low price,we have to question its true value.<<What makes matters worse,>> many departme-
nt stores and shops first raise and then lower the price to draw the attention of custom-
ers,which is a kind of cheating behavior.
    <<I firmly believe that>> a rational and reasonable system of setting prices should 
be built up.In a society full of discounted products,every person has to be careful when-
ever he make purchases for fear that he may be cheated.<<Only when>> the manufacturers i-
mpose the quality,lower the cost and expand the scale can expect to buy products which a-
re both cheap in price and high in quality.
