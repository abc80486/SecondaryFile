    Is Idol Worship a Bad Thing
    Idolizing celebrities is such a common matter among yong people in the
modern society that every one of us may meet it from time to time,when all
kinds of adols are introduced to the public by the mass media.
    However,people hold different views towards idol worship.Some people h-
that the success of positive idols will set a good example for the youth a-
nd encourage them to achieve their personal value.Other people maintain th-
at star-pursuing is largely harmful to the fanatical fans.
    Personally,I agree with the second group of people.I just want to sugg-
est that schools,families as well as the mass media,should shoulder the re-
sponsibility for guiding young people to view the issue in a reasonable wa-
y.I don't agree that young people will benefit if they lose their self-con-
trol and spend too much time and money in order to support their idols.So I
think it is high time that we put an end blind idol worship.
