    Should Teachers' Part-time Jobs Be Permitted
    A national debate has sprung up on whether teachers should be permitte-
d to do part-time jobs.
    Many people strongly oppose the permission of teachers'doing part-time
jobs.They hold that the chief task for college teachers is to teach and re-
search.Part-time jobs will distract their attention and occupy a lot of ti-
me.Moreever,if teachers are not satisfied with their pay,they can move to 
another place or another job.In a word,they believe part-time jobs will la-
rgely hinder normal teaching activities and teacher-student communications.
    From my perspective,I think teachers should be permitted to do part-ti-
me jobs but with extreme care.For one thing,the rights of college teachers
should be respected-they can be fully responsible for their belaviors.For 
another,not all the part-time jobs are time-consuming and harmful to the n-
ormal teaching and research.Last but not least,the time in college is so p-
recious that every teacher will think twice before they adopt a part-time 
job.All in all,the authority should grant them the right.
