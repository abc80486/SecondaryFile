    Should Young People Live with Their Parents after Marriage ?
    It is quite natural for young people to ponder over the question of whether
to live with their parents or not after marriage.
    Many young people will choose not to live with their parents,generally for 
there reasons.On the one hand,people,people are more likely to cherish independence
and less possible to remain at home when they become more mature and experienced.
On the other hand,it may cause inconvenience because the living patterns between
the old and the young are always different.Most important of all,there is inevitably
a generation gap,which may lead to quarrels or even family conflicts.
    Nevertheless,other people adopt a totally different view.For one thing,living
together brings great comfort and happiness,which all people cherish most.For
another,the young couple and the old parents can help and support each other in
many respects.
    FROM WHAT WE HAVE DISCUSSED ABOVE,WE CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT IT DEPENDS
ON PERSONAL CHOICE,IN MY OWN CASE,I will live one block away from my parents in the
future,where we can take care of each other and avoid conflicts.
