    My View on Students'Reading Literary Works
    It becomes a common tendency these days for students to read literary Works
on campus.Many people are opposed to this practice because they think students'
chief task is to study and it is not advisable for them to spend time reading novels,
poems and plays.They also argue that some of the books are not healthy and even
harmful.
    In my mind,however,I can't agree with these people on this occation.If a persion
ever wants to be successful in his life,he should not only master specialized knowledge
but also possess literary taste.At the same time,literary works are often instructive
and inspiring,which can often encourage students to work harder.In addition,it is true
that reading novels and poems takes time,but the students will have nothing to lose If
they improve efficiency.Reading classic literature,as far as I'm concerned,is much better
than playing video games and chatting online.
    In conclusion,reading literary works can be both beneficial and fruitful if we 
choose books successfully and plan our time wisely.
