    My View on Foreign Snacks
    NOWADAYS,THERE IS A GROWING TENDENCY for people to go to eat foreign
snacks such as KFC and MacDonald's,especially for the sake of attractive
taste and convenience.Some people even become addicted to it that they will
go eating every week.PERSONALLY SPEAKING.I DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRACTICE AT 
ALL.
    FIRST OF ALL,foreign snacks provide much more calories than is needed by 
the human body,that is to say,eating snacks will lead to overweight.SECONDLY,
fried foods such as fried chicken and potato chips contain too much fat,
which is harmful to the heart and the vessels.LAST BUT NOT LEAST,foreign
snacks are extremely harmful to children.For example,soft drinks may not
only affect the normal appetite but also cause many diseases such as hyperten-
sion.
    TO WIND UP MY DISCUSSION,MY CONCLUSION IS THAT IT IS NOT ADVISABLE FOR
people,especially children,to go eating foreign snacks too often,because it 
has been commomly believed to be "junk fond",which is a threat to human health.
