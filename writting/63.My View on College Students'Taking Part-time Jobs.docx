    My View on College Students'Taking Part-time jobs
    Nowadays more and more people voice growing concern over college students'taking 
part-time jobs.Some people argue that it is unquestionably beneficial to the students 
in that it can enlarge their horizon and enrich their experience,while others firmly 
hold that part-time jobs of all kinds are harmful so as to hinder the students' normal
college study.
    Personally,I think this quetion should be probed in depth.On the one hand,the first
group is not totally correct because not all part-time jobs are beneficial and not 
harmful.Students are somewhat immatrue and easily led astray by those money-addicted 
employers.On the other hand,the second opinion seems not so satisfactory because we
also witness successful examples in universities home and abroad.Early working experience
can be invaluable as the preparation for future carrer.
    Form what has been discussed above,we can see clearly that the key lies in whether 
the student is able to strike a successful balance between work and study.Otherwise,
the college life will be caught in the so-called vicious cirle no matter whether the 
student takes part-time jobs or not.
