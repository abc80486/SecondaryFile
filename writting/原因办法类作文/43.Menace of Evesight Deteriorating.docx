    Menace of Eyesight Deteriorating
    Nowadays,people spend a lot of time watching TV and staring at computer screen,
which do great harm to their eyes.And more and more people are becoming near-sighted.
    Why are there so many people becoming near-sighted ?The first reason,in my mind,
is that an increasing number of people turn to televisions and computers,and their
harmful rays from the screens are inclined to impose nearsight endness on people.
Furthermore,the high demands from society lay great pressure on people,thus everyone
is encouraged to read more and more to keep up with the world.Last but not least,many
modern people do not have a good habit of using eyes--they overuse their eyes and wear
unsuitable glasses.
    The harmfulness of eyesight deteriorating has become more than obvious at the moment.
first of all,wearing glasses damages people's image.In the second place,nearsightedness
can cause a lot of inconveniences to people's daily life.Thirdly,it can even cause some
other serious diseases.
    Consequently,it is high time that we made great efforts to put an end to eyesight
deteriorating.
