    Don't Hesitate to Protest
    Whenever we talk to others,we should not hesitate to protest especially in two
situations.First,if the matter is not done properly,we should protest.Otherwise,the
wrong practice will go on and on.until it becomes such a serious matter that nobody 
can overlook it any longer.To make matters worse.the most appropriate time for solving
the problem may have passed.Second,if the matter is dishonest or even illegal,we should
not hesitate a moment to protest or even report to the police,or it will harm the
interests of other people or even the whole society.
    Many people don't protest when they should,mainly foor two reasons.In most cases,
they put up with the wrongdoings because the matter is not too serious.It is also 
likely that they do not want to seem to make fuss about trivial matters.Nevertheless,
when they choose not to protest,they do nothing to prevent wrongdongs from spreading.
    If people don't protest when they should,illegal actions even crimes will be on
the rise.Every me of us should learn to from the habit of protesting whenever necessary.
