    Nowadays,campus,which used to be known as ivory tower,is being invaded by
all kinds of crimes.It has become such a serious problem that it has aroused
the concern from the whole society.
    To put an end to such a serious problem,in my mind,it calls for the efforts
from all sides.First of all,the statistics show that some teenager offenders 
are the only children who are spoilt by their parents,and some are those who
have committed crimes due to the divoice of their parents.Therefore,it is 
imperative for parents to learn how to instruct their children.Moreover,for 
school's part,it is unreasonable for teachers to concern only about the student's
academic achievements;instead,they should enhance the moral and ethic education,
and cultavite studens a strong sense of self-discipline.Last but not least,the
local administrative departments in charge of education ought to put the
responsibility system of security inti effect and see to it that the neglect
leading to serious accidents will be punished.
    How can everybody expect to lead a meaningful life if he is not far from
crime and violence ? Only when all of us join in the efforts of fighting against
campus crime at all levels can we expect to have a safe and secure environment
for the students to live in.
