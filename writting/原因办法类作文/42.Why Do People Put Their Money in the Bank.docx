    How Do People Put Their Money in the Bank
    For a number of years,there has been a steady rise in the amount of money
that people save in the bank,although the interest rate has been lowered for 
several times.Three reasons,in my mind,can account for this social phenomenon.
    First and foremost,the living expenses are becoming higher and higher--people
have to accumulate a large amount of money if they want to buy a house or car,
and banks are the safest places to put the money in.In the second place,the 
traditional idea of "preparing for a rainy day"is prevalent throughout the
country--whenever emergency and illnesses arise,money is in need.Last but not
least,many people save money in the bank and take credit cards to go shopping--
it is not only safe but also convenient.
    I firmly believe that if we try our best to make good use of savings,it will
contribute a lot to economic development.
