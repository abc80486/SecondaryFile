    My Favorite Activity
    When asked about my favorite leisure time activity,I will not hesitate a moment to 
say it is public speaking.Whenever I have spare time,I will practice it,which makes me 
happy and excited.I first took part in a speech contest when I was in junior high school.
Although I have not got any prize that time,I begin to love public speaking from then on.
    Although some friends do not like public speaking,I have been practicing it for several
years.The reasons why I enjoy it so much  are three fold.Firstly,after several years'
practice I am more confident,enterprising and easygoing than before.Secondly,the hobby
has helped me make good friends with many teachers and schoolmates--I have become more
careful,reasonable and responsible.
    Just like many other people,public speaking has become part of my like.I believe I 
will enjoy it forever,and recommend it to others.
