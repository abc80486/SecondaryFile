    Living a Colorful Life on Campus
    It is necessary that university students make life on campus as colorful as
possible.On the one hand,only when university life is colorful can it be meaningful
and fruitful.On the other hand,monotonous and lonely life is not healthy--the 
inversity should be a place where students can share opinion,display talents or
study subjects thoroughly,and a place where students play leading roles.
    There are many ways to live a colorful life on campus,among which joining
various bands is the easiest one.By attending musical bands,literary communities
and sports clubs,college students can share their hobbies with a lot of friends.
In  addition,social investigation is also a good choice.Through various activities,
the students will not only get to know the outside world but also become more
responsible and reasonable.
    As far as I am concerned,I will combine the two methods mentioned above.I 
enjoyed jazz music and took part in the music band of our college last year.
I will forget about unhappiness and sorrow whenever I start playing my beloved
saxophone.Moreever,I will take an active part in social practice,which is most 
helpful for personality development.
