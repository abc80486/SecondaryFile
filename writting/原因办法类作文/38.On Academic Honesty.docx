    In recent years,the problem of academic fraud has become increasingly serious
on university campuses,and more people voice growing concern over it.
    Such a phenomenon has brought many unfavorable consequences.To begin with,
there is no doubt that it has blocked the country's scientific development.Second,
the confession of some reputable professors that they have plagiarized others'works
seriously undermines the public trust in intellectual integrity.Last but not least,
scholars lacking in professional integrity exert a bad influence on young students,
who followed the trend instead of pursuing innovation.
    It is more than necessary that all the relevant departments join in the efforts
to fight against this notorious phenomenon.As to the administations concernd,it is 
high time for them to take effective meatures to curb the misconducts and encourage
creativity in academic field.Moreover,it is crucial for the government to oversee the
work of researchers.Only when every member of the society realizes the harm brought
by academic dishonesty can we put on end to the abominable practice.
