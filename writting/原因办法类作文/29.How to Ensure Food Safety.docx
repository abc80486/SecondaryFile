    How to Ensure Food Safety
    As is known to all,food to human being is as water to fish.It is of utmost
importance to everyone.However,it's quite worrying that nowadays the Safety
problems of food are posing a grave threat to the public interest.
    In recent years,some money-oriented businessmen resort to illegal means
in order to extract more profits from consumers.They betray their conscience
by injecting water into pork,adding harmful substance to milk,or applying too
much agricultural chemical to crops.Many consumers develop severe illnesses which
result from eating tainted food.
    Governments should be greatly responsible for launching a compaign against
this phenomenon.Firstly,it is important to build a wide-ranging surveillance
system in order to guarantee the quality and safety of products.secondly,laws
and regulations should be made to punish those who are selfish and irresponsible.
    But the governments alone cannot ensure the final success in uprooting the 
food safety problem,for consumers themselves should also be fully aware of
the potential harm of certain problematic products.
