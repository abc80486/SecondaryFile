    How to Get a Job after Graduation
    The past decade has witnessed a more and more fierce competition in the job market.
Consequenly students voice growing concern over how to get a job after graduation.To 
this problem,in my mind,there are at least the following three approaches.  
    First of all,the main approach is to take park in grand recruiting fairs in big
cities.The student hands in his resume and waits for the notice of an interview.
Secondly,the student can go over the advertisements on newspapers,TV or the Internet
to find a satisfactory job.Of course he should also wait for reply after sending out
applications.Finally,going directly to an ideal company is a brave behavior,which
sounds pretty rare among the job hunters.
    Personslly,I would like to choose the second method in my own practice.On the one
hand,I don't want to have a try at those companies which have not advertised in the
mass media.The success rate is so rare that I cannot afford the time and energy.On
the other hand,I would not like to go to those crowded recruiting fairs,which often
provide only poor-paying posts which are neither challenging nor promising.As long 
as I am sure of making sufficient preparations and distinguishing myself during 
interviews,it is out of question for me to get the ideal job which I have been
dreaming of.
