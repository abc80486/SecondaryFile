    Civil Servant Craze in China
    Some people think working as a civil servant is the best way to maintain a stable
life,and to have great expectations.And this belief motivates millions of people to
take civil servant examination.Deep in my heart,I also have been asking myself the same
question again and again:why do I have little interest in civil servant examination?
The reasons,in my mind,can be summed up in three aspects.
    First of all,it is a waste of time and money for both the nation and the candidates
to arrange or prepare for the civil servant examination.In the second place,the 
unbelievably high ratio of the applicants to the posts may lead to government corruption.
Last but not least,it is unreasonable for people to plunge into taking the examination
without refecting on their own strengths and weaknesses.
    Such an attitude,I firmly believe,will help me embark on the right tract of both
job-hunting and my future life.To sum up,it is not advisable for job-seekers to take
civil servant examination blindly.It is important to provide guidance for job-seekers
to form a rational judgment on their potentials and future careers.In addition,the
society and government should offer more job opportunities so that people have a wider
range of job choices.
