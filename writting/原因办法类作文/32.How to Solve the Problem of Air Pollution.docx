    If the city residents ever want to improve living quality,the problem of air
pollution has to be solved.Which more and more factories being set up,plenty of
people flooding into cities and a great many cars and buses running to the roads,
this problem has been much more serious.
    First of all,big factories should abide by the environmental laws and rules
closely,not giving off waste gases into the air directly without disposal.
What's more,the municipal government should call on the community to plant more
trees,which can purity the air and improve air quality.Finally,the tail gases
from cars,buses and trucks should never exceed the national standard.Only when
all the people stop pursuing personal interests at the price of air pollution 
can we hope to put an end to this unfavorable situation.
    The air quality is of great importance to anybody at any time and place.
If a person refuses to learn cooperation and discipline,how can he enjoy the 
privilege of higher living quality ?
