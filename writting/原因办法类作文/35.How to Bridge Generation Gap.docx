    How to Bridge Generation Gap
    The recent years have witnessed an unfavorable social phenomenon--the Gap
between parents and their children is widening.
    After contemplation and meditation,we can find three possible reasons which
account for this trend.First of all,young people have completely different
outlooks on their life as a result of the rapid pace of modern life.What's more,
some parents take it for granted that their children should be obedient and 
respectful to them,unaware that self-consciousness of their children has become
stronger then ever.In the third place,occupied with working staff,parents find
it hard to have time to communicate with their children.
    The solution to this problem seems more than clear on this occasion.Firstly,
it is very important for parents to realize the changes happening to their
children so that they will approach educational issues more appropriately.Moreover,
young people should be aware of the different background where their parents
were brought up,and try to understand it.Last but by no means least,no matter
how busy parents are,they must set aside time to communicate with their children
and make sure that they feel loved and trusted.
    It is quite natural that we meet such problems with the development of
society and personal growth of children.As long as the parents and children make
joint efforts,a sound solution is not far away.
