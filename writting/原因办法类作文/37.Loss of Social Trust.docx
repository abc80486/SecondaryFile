    Loss of Social Trust
    With the development of national economy,a worrying social problem also
arises--people gradually trust each other less and less,especially,strangers.
    This phenomenon will lose a lot of fun since they become cautious all the
time.What makes matters worse,the general expense of doing things rises abruptly
as a result of the fact that people don't want to help strangers.Finally,if this
matter is not properly settled,it will pose a threat to national education.
    It is high time that we called on the efforts from all sides to deal with 
this problem properly.For one thing,the government should make all efforts to
creat a harmonious social atmosphere.For another,teachers should seize every
chance to stimulate affection and unselfishness in the hearts of the students.
Finally,the mass media should also play a positive role in restoring mutual
trust.
    No matter whether this problem is a natural result of social development.It
is important that we find a satisfactory solution to it in this transitional
period.
