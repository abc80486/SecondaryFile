    Buying a House Downtown or in the Suburbs ?
    CURRENLY,THE MAJOR DILEMMA WHICH MOST people FACE when purchasing
houses IS TO buy a house downtown OR in the suburbs.
    THOSE WHO decide to buy a house downtown have long been dreaming of
living in a house of their own in the center of a city.THEY BELIEVE THAT ONLY BY
living in a house downtown can they live a convenient lift,as they can easily
get to supermarkets,restaurants,hospital and cinemas.
    OTHER PEOPLE,HOWEVER,BELIEVE THAT it is not realistic and necessary for all
people to buy a house downtown.It is true that it can be convenient when living
downtown,but this is not to say that you will feel inconvenient when you live
in the suburbs.With the process of urbanization,the difference will be-
come smaller and smaller.FURTHERMORE,you can buy a car with the money you
save while buying the house.THE BEST WAY IS to keep balance between location,
price and other factors.
   NO MATTER WHICH CHOICE a person WILL FINALLY MAKE,HE HAS TO BE EXTREMELY
CAREFUL TO INTO HIS UNIQUE SITUATION AND CONSULT THE PREDECESSORS FOR THEIR
ADVICE.HE WILL MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE IF HE KNOWS his goal in life and how to
make decisions according to the goal.
