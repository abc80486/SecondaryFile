    WHEN IT COMES TO the attitude to the traditional Chinese culture,SOME OF
THE PEOPLE WILL CHOOSE TO observe our tradition WHILE OTHERS WANT TO make changes
of the ancient heritage.Which is the right attitude,inheritance or innovation ?
    THOSE PEOPLE WHO DECIDE TO be faithful to our tradition ARGUE THAT it is sig-
nificant for China,a country with a glorious and long history,to keep its own
characteristics.FURTHERMORE,traditional culture will be helpful for the con-
struction of a stable and cohesive nation.
    THOSE PEOPLE WHO PREFER cultural innovation NAINTAIN THAT with the rapid
development of globalization,China will inevitable absorb some elements of
foreign cultures.MOREOVER,in order to survive in the competitive era,we need
to eliminate the dross of our culture and adapt to the speedy rhythm of the
modern world.
    IN MY OPINION,WE SHOULD hold a dialectical attitude towards the issue.TO
BEGIN WITH,we will get lost if we abandon the heritage left by our ancestors.
SECOND,by no means can China isolate herself from other parts of the Earth.
Generally speaking,it is advisable for us to combine the preservation and de-
velopment of our traditional culture.
