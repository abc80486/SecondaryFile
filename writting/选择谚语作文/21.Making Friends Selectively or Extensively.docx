    Making Friends Selectively or Extensively ?
    WHENEVER PEOPLE make friends,THEY WILL COME ACROSS THE PROBLEM OF 
WHETHER THEY SHOULD make friends selectively OR extensively,AND IT IS NATURAL
FOR DIFFERENT OPINIONS TO ARISE.
    SOME PEOPLE THINK WE SHOULD make friends selectively.THEY SAY THAT not 
all people are suitable for us and easy to get along with.FURTHERMORE,SOME
people want to take advantage of us by becoming our good friends,which we
should be cautious of.THEREFORE,WE SHOULD be careful to choose honest and
trustworthy friends.
    BUT SOME PEOPLE THINK OTHERWISE,THEY ARGUE THAT IN AN AGE WHEN SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOP AT A FANASTIC SPEED,WE SHOULD NOT ONLY make friends
in our own community BUT ALSO from all lines of work,who will help us in vari-
ous ways later.ONLY WHEN WE make friends extensively CAN WE KEEP WITH THE
PACE OF SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT.
    IN MY OPINION,WE SHOULD COMBINE selective friend-making WITH extensive
friend-making.FIRST,we should make a careful selection of the friends who
are honst in nature and similar in interest.SECOND,once the selection is 
made,we should make as many good friends as we can.ONLY IN THIS WAY CAN 
WE benefit the most from making friends.
