    Actions Speak Louder than Words
    There is a famous saying"Actions speak louder than word",which means you should
take actions rather than just talk it to others.If you want to be successful,you
should put you belief or theory into practice and prove that it is right and valuable.
    A case in point is the dream of a child.All people have an ideal since childhood,
but many of them never realize it because they never carry it out.On the contrary,
those who make repeated efforts to implement it are most likely to turn the childhood
dream into reality.
    When it comes to education,it is also the case.Only by speaking honestly and 
behaving themselves appropriately can teachers and parents hope students to regard
them as models and learn from them.
    Form what has been discussed above,we should understand the meaning of "Actions 
speak louder than words"more clearly.On the one hand,you can talk to others about 
your plans,beliefs and feelings.On the other hand,no plan or beliefs are significant
until you put them into practice.The best way is to keep silent and let your actions
speak for themselves.
