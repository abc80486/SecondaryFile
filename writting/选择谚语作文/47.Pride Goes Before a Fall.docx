    Pride Goes Before a Fall
    "Pride goes before a fall"is a well-known proverb which all of u are familiar with.
I fully agree with it and its implication,in my mind,can be justified in three respects.
    First,if you are too pround of your success,you may stop working hard and no long
make progress.In this case you will most probably fail next time.Second,great men in 
history could always be modest,which,in my mind,is vital to their success.Third,looking
at the matter from another perspctive,we will find that our achievement is nothing to
be prond of when compareed to the fantastic dream in our heart--if we want to realize
our life's ultimate goal,we can never stop pursuing.
    Living in an age when most people are hardworking,modesty seems more than necessary.
As the modern competition becomes more and more fierce,we should realize the importance
of modesty.If we can be modest in proper situation,we can make progress constantly,and
life will be more meaningful.
