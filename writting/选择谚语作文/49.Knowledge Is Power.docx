    Kownledeg Is Power
    Have you ever thought of the famous proverb"Knowledeg is power"?To me,it is
meaningful and significant in three respects.
    In the first place,from the perspective of the  whole mankind,the human history
of development and progress is also a history from ignorance to civilization.In the
second place,from the perspective of a single person,the process of growing up
should be accompanied by accumulation of knowledeg.Otherwise,he has no difference 
from the ancestors who were helpness before the harsh natural environment.Finally,
from the perspective of a nation,those with high literacy rate will be sure to
develop quickly because knowledge will lead to advancement in science and technology
in a brand-new information era.
    We can learn a lot from this proverb and put it into practice==we should seize 
every possible chance to expand our knowledge.On the one hand,we should read as many
good books as possible to enrich ourselves.On the other hand,we should learn knowledge
and experience from all kinds of people.Only in this way can we become powerful
mentally and spiritually.
