    Variety Is the Spice of Life
    When we talk of the famous proverb"Variety is the spice if life",we should not simply
label it as right or wrong,but explore it in depth.
    This proverb is especially true under several situations.First,all people enjoy colorful
life and hate monotonons life--variety can make them more efficient and energetis.Scond,new
experiences always bring new ideas and feelings,which are vital for us to understand the
essence of life.Third,if we never want to improve ourselves,we should constantly change
for the better by making new attempts.
    Nevertheless,there are also some exceptions.Many thing,in my belief,should be kept
unchanged no matter how time flies.We should hold on to our dream if we ever want to turn
it into reality.And we should always be loyal to our parents,parters and friends.
    In a word,we can draw the conclusion that in most cases"Variety is the spice of life",
but in certain circumstances,staying unchanged is the right choice.
