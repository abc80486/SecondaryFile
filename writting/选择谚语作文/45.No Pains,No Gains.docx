    No Pains,No Gains
    The well-known proverb"No pains,no gains"has long been accepted by all of us.It tells us
that we have to make strenuous efforts whenever we want to be successful in a certain field.
    Let's take English study as an example.If we want to improve our listening ability,we
have to keep on listening to different materials and make records from time to time,It is also
true with spoken English.Listening to teachers attentively in class and reading books are far
from enough--you should practice talking with partners every week.
    Another good case in point is acrobatics.Nobody is born a good acrobat,and noe can only
become a skilled acrobat after countless failures.All of us feel excited when they win grand
prizes in international competitions,but who knows how many hardships they have endureed?
    Judging from the examples given above,we may safely come to the conclusion that no pains,
no gains.So why not try our best to learn our specialties well?I am sure we will become 
experienced and skillful if we never give up.
