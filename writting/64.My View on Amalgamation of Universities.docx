    My View on Amalgamation of Universities
    Recently there have been many reports of amalgamation of universities.It turns a new 
page of advanced education in China,and will have far-reaching effects in the forthconing
years.
    The biggest benefit,in my eyes,is that merging often results in a comprehensive 
university with increased overall strength.To take part in international competitions,we 
need more universities of this kind.In addition,the integration of staff members will 
significantly improve the quality of both teaching and research.Finally,reorganization
will optimize the disposition of limited resources,which is the symbol of successful
educational reform.
    Apart from the benefits mentioned above,we should also face seveal unavoidable challeges.
In the first place,the integration process itself will be difficult even painful--many people
may need to sacrifice their own interests for the whole university.In the second place,the 
management of such big universities is not easy at all.What's the most important,the most 
successful university is not necessarily the largest one or the one with the largest number
of students--the key lies in the unique spirit of the university.Only when we deal with these
problems successfully can we benefit the most from university amalgamation.
