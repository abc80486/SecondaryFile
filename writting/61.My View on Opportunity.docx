    My View on Opportunity
    Different people have different views on opportunity,some people think that
there are few opportunity in the world,while others argue that every body will have
some kind of opportunity along his life route.
    As far as I am concerned,I agree with the latter opinion.For one thing,I firmly
believe opportunities are everywhere around us.No one will be unluckly enough to
have no opportunities all the time,because"every dog has his day".For another,since
opportunities are transient,we have to make good preparations and improve ourselves.
Just think of Newton,who discovered the Law of Gravity when many people had watched
an apple falling ahead of them.
    Taking all these factors into consideration,we may safely come to the conclusion
that there are quite a few opportunities in our society.Only if we get prepared can 
we seize the opportunities instead of letting them slip by,just as thw saying goes,
"opportunities are only for the prepared minds."
