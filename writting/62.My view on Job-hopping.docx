    My View on Job-hopping
    People's opinions are always different once they talk about job-hopping.Those who 
never change their jobs throughout their lives maintain that they have accumulated enough
experience to work smoothly and efficiently,so what's the point of changing to another
job ?They also firmly believe that anyone who wants to excel in his specialty has to 
work hard on the same post for years to acquired skills and knowledge.
    Many people think otherwise,On the one hand,if the present job can offer neither
satisfactory working conditions nor future opportunities,they will not hesitate a moment
to quit.On the other hand,they hold that life belong us only once and job-hopping can 
privide rich and exciting experiences.
    My own opinion is that job-hopping,in this fast-developing information era,has become 
more than common and acceptable.If we want to keep pace with the times,we have to change 
for the faster,the higher and the strong.If life is a journey,we have nothing to regret
so long as we put meaning into it.So why not make a change ?
